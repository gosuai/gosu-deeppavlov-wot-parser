Its thick armor, generous gun selection, and easy-to-learn play style make it one of the best starter tanks and allow it to easily dominate in the hands of a skilled player. In real life, the KV-1 was designed to be a nigh-invulnerable spearhead in assaults against heavily defended areas, and this is reflected in World of Tanks. The KV-1 boasts very thick all-around hull armor, and a turret that seems even tougher due to its naturally curved shape. This allows it to [[Tactics#Sidescraping.2FReverse_angling|sidescrape]] with ease and withstand serious beatings. Note that sidescraping is actually highly recommended here, as the KV-1's armor, while thick, is also flat when faced from the front and greatly benefits from angling. The KV-1 also offers a generous selection of guns: a rapid-firing and highly accurate 57mm, an extremely powerful but relatively unreliable 122mm howitzer, or a hard-hitting 85mm which mediates between the two. \n",

Furthermore, the KV-1 is very slow and turns sluggishly, which can make it vulnerable especially against higher-tiered opponents. However, don't let that dissuade you as the remarkable penetration of the gun means that as long as the KV-1 is one the field, even in a tier VII game, it is capable of still making a difference.\n",

The slogan on the turret side reads \"Victory will be ours.\"]]The Kliment Voroshilov (KV) tanks were a series of Soviet Heavy tanks, named after the Soviet defense commissar and politician Kliment Voroshilov. The KV series were known for their extremely-heavy armor protection during the early war, especially during the first year of the invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II. Almost completely immune to the 7.5 cm KwK 37 and 3.7 cm KwK 36 guns mounted on the early Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks, until better guns were developed, often the only way to defeat a KV was a point-blank shot to the rear. Prior to the invasion, about 500 of the over 22,000 tanks in Soviet service at the time were of the KV-1 type. When the KV-1 appeared, it outclassed the French Char B1, the only Heavy tank used in the world at that time. Yet, in the end, it turned out that there was little sense in producing the expensive KV tanks, as the T-34 medium tank performed better (or at least equally) in all practical respects. Later in the war, the KV series have become a base of development of the excellent Iosif Stalin tank.\n",

      "== Development ==\n",
      "After disappointing results with the multi-turreted T-35 Heavy tank, Soviet tank designers started drawing up replacements. The T-35 conformed to the 1920s notion of a 'breakthrough tank' with very-heavy firepower and armor protection, but poor mobility. The Spanish Civil War demonstrated the need for much-heavier armor on tanks, and was the main influence on Soviet tank design just prior to World War II. Several competing designs were offered, and even more were drawn up prior to reaching prototype stage. All had heavy armor, torsion-bar suspension, wide tracks, and were of welded and cast construction. One of the main competing designs was the SMK, which lowered the number of turrets from the T-35's five to two, mounting the same combination of 76.2 mm and 45 mm weapons. When two prototypes were ordered though, it was decided to create one with only a single turret, but more armor. This new single-turret tank was the KV. The smaller hull and single turret enabled the designer to install heavy frontal and turret armor while keeping the weight within manageable limits.[[image:KV-Trials-bw.jpg|thumb|200px|right|KV-1 On trials]]\n",
      "When the Soviets entered the Winter War, the SMK, KV, and a third design, the T-100, were sent to be tested in combat conditions. The heavy armor of the KV proved highly-resistant to Finnish anti-tank weapons, making it more effective than the other designs. It was soon put into production, both as the original 76-mm-armed KV-1 Heavy Tank and the 152 mm howitzer-mounting assault gun, the KV-2 Heavy Artillery Tank.\n",
      "The KV's strengths included armor that was impenetrable by any tank-mounted weapon then in service except at point-blank range, good firepower, and good traction on soft ground. It also had serious flaws: it was difficult to steer, the transmission was unreliable, and the ergonomics were poor, with limited visibility and no turret basket. Furthermore, the 45-ton KV was simply too heavy. This severely impacted the maneuverability, not so much in terms of maximum speed, but in its inability to cross many bridges that medium tanks could cross. The KV outweighed most other tanks of the era, being about twice as heavy as the heaviest contemporary German tank. KVs were never equipped with a snorkeling system to ford rivers on the bottom, so they had to be left to travel to an adequate bridge. As applique armor and other improvements were added without increasing engine power, and later models were less capable of keeping up to speed with medium tanks and had more trouble with difficult terrain.\n",

Reserve Front 43rd Army 109th Tank Division Sep. 1941. The sign on the turret translates as \"Kill the fascist\"]]\n",
      "By 1942, when the Germans were fielding large numbers of long-barrelled 50 mm and 75 mm guns, the KV's armor was no longer invincible. The KV-1's side, top, and turret armor could also be penetrated by the high-velocity MK 101 carried by German ground attack aircraft such as the Henschel Hs 129, requiring the installation of additional field-expedient appliqué armor. The KV-1's 76.2 mm gun also came in for criticism. While adequate against all German tanks, it was the same gun as carried by smaller, faster, and cheaper T-34 medium tanks. In 1943, it was determined that this gun could not penetrate the frontal armor of the new Tiger, the first German Heavy tank, fortunately captured near Leningrad. The KV-1 was also much more difficult to manufacture and thus, more expensive than the T-34. In short, its advantages no longer outweighed its drawbacks.\n",
      "Nonetheless, because of its initial superior performance, the KV-1 was chosen as one of the few tanks to continue being built following the Soviet reorganization of tank production. Due to the new standardization, it shared the similar engine (the KV used a 600 hp V-2K modification of the T-34's V-2 diesel engine) and gun (the KV had a ZiS-5 main gun, while the T-34 had a similar F-34 main gun) as the T-34, was built in large quantities, and received frequent upgrades.\n",
      "When production shifted to the Ural Mountains 'Tankograd' complex, the KV-2 was dropped. While impressive on paper, it had been designed as a slow-moving bunker-buster. It was less useful in the highly-mobile, fluid warfare that developed in World War II. The turret was so heavy it was difficult to traverse on non-level terrain, and it was expensive to produce. Only about 250 KV-2s were made, all in 1940-41, making it one of the rarer Soviet tanks.\n",
      "As the war continued, the KV-1 continued to get more armor to compensate for the increasing effectiveness of German weapons. This culminated in the KV-1 model 1942 (German designation KV-1C), which had very heavy armor, but lacked a corresponding improvement to the engine. Tankers complained that although they were well-protected, their mobility was poor and they had no firepower advantage over the T-34 medium tank. In response to criticisms, the lighter KV-1S (Russian language: КВ-1С) was released, with thinner armor and a smaller, lower turret in order to reclaim some speed. Importantly, the KV-1S also had a commander's cupola with all-around vision blocks, a first for a Soviet Heavy tank. However, the thinning-out of the armor called into question why the tank was being produced at all, when the T-34 could seemingly do everything the KV could do and much more cheaply. The Soviet Heavy tank program was close to cancellation in mid-1943. \n",
      "The appearance of the German Panther tank in the summer of 1943 convinced the Red Army to make a serious upgrade of its tank force for the first time since 1941. Soviet tanks needed bigger guns to take on the growing numbers of Panthers and the few Tigers.\n",
      "A stopgap upgrade to the KV series was the short-lived KV-85 or Objekt 239. This was a KV-1S with a new turret designed for the IS-85, mounting the same 85 mm D-5T gun as the SU-85 and early versions of the T-34-85. Already-high demand for the gun slowed production of the KV-85 tremendously, and only 148 were built before the KV design was replaced. The KV-85 was produced in the fall and winter of 1943-44; they were sent to the front as of September 1943, and production of the KV-85 was stopped by the spring of 1944 once the IS-2 entered full scale production.\n",

      "'''Raseiniai'''\n",
      "[[image:German officers are examining the damaged Soviet KV-1 heavy tank screened with additional armor It probably belonged to the 101st Tank Division. Western Front, executive.jpg|thumb|200px|left|German officers are examining the damaged Soviet KV-1 Heavy tank screened with additional armor. It probably belonged to the 101st Tank Division.]]\n",
      "When Operation Barbarossa began, the Red Army was equipped with 508 new KV tanks. Its armor was so effective that the Germans were incapable of destroying it with their tanks or anti-tank weapons, and had to rely on air support and 88 mm anti-aircraft artillery (flak) or 105 mm howitzers to knock them out. Most of these tanks, and the effective T-34s, were parcelled out to units in small numbers and poorly supplied, but at the Battle of Raseiniai they were used to good effect. On 23–24 June, a single KV-2 effectively pinned down elements of the German 6th Panzer Division for a full day at the bridgeheads of the Dubysa River below Raseiniai, Lithuania, playing a prominent role in delaying the advance of Panzergruppe 4 on Leningrad until it ran out of ammunition and the crew was forced to abandon the tank and withdraw.\n",
      "According to Panzer Operations, however, the tank (said to be a KV-1), after destroying several antitank guns, their crews, and an 88 mm flak gun, was hit repeatedly with rounds from another 88 mm gun. The crew was knocked unconscious, and recovered only to be killed by an exploding grenade. They were buried with full honors, uncommon for other troops. The English version indicates that Erhard Raus, the author, may have mistaken similar events and people, so this may be an error.\n",

      "'''Krasnogvardeysk'''\n",
      "[[image:Wrecked KV-1 tank, Stalingrad, Russia, Aug 1942, photo 1 of 3.jpg |thumb|200px|right| Wrecked KV-1 tank, Stalingrad, Russia, Aug 1942. Note the multipule hit marks on the tanks hull and turret.]]\n",
      "On August 14, 1941, the vanguard of the German 8th Panzer Division approached Krasnogvardeysk (Gatchina) near Leningrad (St Petersburg), and the only Soviet force available at the time to attempt to stop the German advance consisted of five well-hidden KV-1 tanks, dug in within a grove at the edge of a swamp. KV-1 tank no. 864 was commanded by the leader of this small force, Lieutenant Zinoviy Kolobanov.\n",
      "German forces attacked Krasnogvardeysk from three directions. Near Noviy Uchkhoz settlement the geography favored the Soviet defenders as the only road in the region passed the swamp, and the defenders commanded this choke point from their hidden position. Lieutenant Kolobanov had carefully studied the situation and readied his detachment the day before. Each KV-1 tank carried twice the normal amount of ammunition, two-thirds being armor-piercing rounds. Kolobanov ordered his other commanders to hold their fire and await orders. He did not want to reveal the total force, so only one exposed tank at a time would engage the enemy.\n",
      "On August 14, the German 8th Panzer Division's vanguard ventured directly into the well-prepared Soviet ambush, with Kolobanov's tank knocking out the lead German tank with its first shot. The Germans falsely assumed that their lead tank had hit an anti-tank mine, and failed to realize that they had been ambushed. The German column stopped, giving Kolobanov the opportunity to destroy the second tank. Only then did the Germans realize they were under attack, but they failed to find the source of the shots. While the German tanks were firing blindly, Kolobanov knocked out the trailing German tank, thus boxing in the entire column.\n",
      "Although the Germans correctly guessed the direction of fire, they could only spot Lieutenant Kolobanov's tank, and now attempted to engage an unseen enemy. German tanks moving off the road bogged down in the surrounding soft ground, becoming easy targets. 22 German tanks and 2 towed artillery pieces fell victim to Kolobanov's No. 864 before it ran out of ammunition. Kolobanov ordered in another KV-1, and 21 more German tanks were destroyed before the half-hour battle ended. A total of 43 German tanks were destroyed by just five Soviet KV-1s (two more remained in reserve).[[image:KV1 tank bw.jpg |thumb|200px|left| A KV-1, on the Eastern front being examined by a German panzer officer]]\n",
      "After the battle, the crew of No. 864 counted a total of 135 hits on their tank, none of which had penetrated the KV-1's armor. Lieutenant Kolobanov was awarded the Order of Lenin, while his driver Usov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Later on, former Captain Zinoviy Kolobanov was again decorated by Soviet authorities, despite having been convicted and downgraded after the Winter War for \"fraternizing with the enemy.\" After the end of World War II, Lieutenant Kolobanov served in the Soviet occupation zone in East Germany, where he was convicted again when a subordinate escaped to the British occupation zone, and was transferred to the reserves.\n",
      "The battle for Krasnogvardeysk was covered up by Soviet propaganda. A monument dedicated to this battle was installed in the village of Noviy Uchkhoz in 1980, at the place where Kolobanov's KV-1 was dug in, due solely to the demands of the villagers. Unfortunately, it was impossible to find a KV-1 tank, so an IS-2 Heavy tank was installed there instead.\n",
      "The Soviet victory was the result of a well-planned ambush in advantageous ground and of technical superiority. Most of the German tanks in this battle were Panzer IIs, armed with 20 mm guns, and a few Panzer IIIs armed with 37 mm KwK 36 L/46.5 guns. The German tank guns had neither the range nor the power of the 76 mm main gun of a KV-1, and the narrower track width of the German tanks caused them to become trapped in the swampy ground.\n",

R73 KV4  In reality, everything started two weeks before. R73 KV4  Having studied the intelligence report, GAU assumed that the 90 ton tank was armed with a tank version of the 105 mm Flak 39. R73 KV4  This gun was purchased in 1940 by a Soviet commission. R73 KV4  Trials demonstrated that a 130 mm armour plate provided adequate defense from this gun. R73 KV4 \n",

      "On March 21st, 1941, tactical-technical requirements were composed for the tank that would be named KV-4. R73 KV4  Its mass was estimated at 70-72 tons. R73 KV4  The front of the hull and the entire turret would have 130 mm of armour, the sides of the hull would have 120 mm.

R73 KV4  The approach to the KV-4 changed as well. R73 KV4  Its mass increased to 75 tons, and the armour could potentially increase to 140-150 mm. R73 KV4  The sides thickened to 125 mm.

R73 KV4  The only constants were the engine (M-40), mass (80-100 tons) and the presence of a turret. R73 KV4  A multi-turret layout was allowed. R73 KV4  The main gun would be a 107 mm ZiS-6, and the military insisted on a secondary 45 mm gun. R73 KV4  In total, 27 projects were provided for the contest.

R73 KV4  Without coming up with any excessive fantasies, Nikolai Leonidovich approached the issue conservatively and expanded the T-220 tank.

R73 KV4  The T-220 also donated its commander's cupola (with some changes), equipped with a DT machinegun. R73 KV4  The armament, a 107 mm and a 45 mm gun, was combined into a single system.

      "\n",
      "The second place was taken by a collective design by K. R73 KV4 I. R73 KV4  Kuzmin, P. R73 KV4 S. R73 KV4  Tarapanin, and V. R73 KV4 I. R73 KV4  Tarotko (some sources list S. R73 KV4 V. R73 KV4  Mitskevich instead of Tarapanin). R73 KV4  Kuzmin and Tarotko later proved themselves to be talented hull designers. R73 KV4  The KV-4 tank proposed by this group was unusual. R73 KV4  Its fighting compartment was moved to the back, and the engine was placed in the center. R73 KV4  The main gun was placed in a casemate with a wide horizontal range. R73 KV4  The 45 mm gun was in a separate turret. R73 KV4  The mass of the tank was 88 kph, and the speed was estimated at 36 kph. R73 KV4 \n",

      "The third place was taken by N. R73 KV4 V. R73 KV4  Tseits. R73 KV4  Nikolai Valentinovich was the most experienced designer at the Kirov factory, starting his job in the 1920s, and having a wide variety of vehicles under his belt. R73 KV4  Tseits' design was progressive and conservative at the same time. R73 KV4  The second gun was discarded, as he considered it unnecessary. R73 KV4  Tseits' design is characterized by a tall turret, allowing the vertical placement of one-piece 107 mm shells. R73 KV4  In theory, this layout would greatly ease the loader's job. R73 KV4  In order to compensate for the tall turret, the hull was made as low as possible. R73 KV4  A \"step\" separated the fighting and engine compartments. R73 KV4 \n",

      "Another project received praise, designed by A. R73 KV4 S. R73 KV4  Yermolayev, who proposed two variants. R73 KV4  The first 95 ton KV-4 had two turrets. R73 KV4  The main one had a 107 mm gun, and the second, placed in front of it, had a 45 mm gun. R73 KV4  The second variant was the same, but the 45 mm gun turret was missing, taking 5 tons of weight with it. R73 KV4  Yermolayev must have remembered the SMK, the development of which he was in charge of. R73 KV4  It's worth noting that at least five other authors used the same layout as Yermolayev.

      "The heaviest design was by G. R73 KV4 V. R73 KV4  Kruchenyh, who later designed the turret for the IS-3. R73 KV4  Like Kuzmin, Tarapanin, and Tarotko, the engine in this design was moved forward. R73 KV4  The tank had two turrets, one on top of another. R73 KV4  A commander's cupola with a machinegun made up the third level. R73 KV4  Krucheniy's KV-4 weighed a whopping 107 tons. R73 KV4  The idea of turrets stacked on top of one another came up in five other projects. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "At last, let us mention the KV-4 designed by N. R73 KV4 F. R73 KV4  Shashmurin. R73 KV4  Nikolai Fedorovich indexed the KV-4 and KV-5 projects \"BS\", which he decoded as \"a madman's nonsense\" (bred sumashedshevo).

      "\"Having received the task to design a multi-turreted cyclops among the other leading designers of the bureau, I, without the enthusiasm about that condition (just think, we just rejected the \"supermarket\" SMK) I made a \"knight's move\", rejecting turrets altogether, and doing what I once did for the KV-1, installing the M-10 howitzer in a caponier structure, a casemate. R73 KV4  Since we just made a super-heavy KV-3 tank, I didn't think too hard about a new one. R73 KV4  I took off the turret and repeated my previous work, a high power SPG, installing Grabin's 107 mm gun. R73 KV4  I explained in a note that, if necessary, the gun could be removed and replaced with an infantry squad. R73 KV4  This modification was not allowed to enter the competition, as it violated the conditions: not enough armour, mass outside the 80-100 ton range, no turrets. R73 KV4  In order to avoid a conflict, I made a compromise. R73 KV4  Maintaining that a superheavy cannot be a tank, I added the necessary protection, reaching about 90 tons. R73 KV4  I kept the main gun in a casemate, but added a KV-1 turret on the roof. R73 KV4  I. R73 KV4 M. R73 KV4  Zaltsmann liked the design (due to its \"reasonable universality\", as he called it) and I received a second place award, 1000 roubles.

      "On May 9th, 1941, the contest winners were annouced. R73 KV4  Dukhov received 5000 roubles for first place. R73 KV4  Kuzmin, Tarotko, and Mitskevich received 3000 for their second place project. R73 KV4  Tseits, Yermolayev, and Sychev received 2000 roubles each. R73 KV4  Shashmurin received 1500 roubles. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "After that, work on the KV-4 went slowly. R73 KV4  According to the decree, the project was due in mid June, but judging by the correspondence sent, not much progress was made towards that goal. R73 KV4  Things got to the point that Marshall Kulik himself intervened and demanded that work speed up. R73 KV4  No one knows how much effect that had, since his letter was dated June 12th, and the war started ten days later. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "Another stakeholder, the NKPS, was doing much better. R73 KV4  GABTU and NKPS actively exchanged mail regarding railroad platforms for new tanks since spring of 1941. R73 KV4  The goal at first was 72 tons, but in April, the numbers changed to 80-100 tons. R73 KV4  GABTU ordered 200 of these platforms for 1941 and 1500 for 1942. R73 KV4  Unlike the tankers, the railroaders completed their mission. R73 KV4  In 1941, production of six-axle 120 ton platforms began, with length and weight capacity to spare. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the KV-5, almost no work was done until June of 1941. R73 KV4  According to Zaltsmann's letters, there was an idea to announce a prize for the winning KV-5 design as well, but that idea was dropped. R73 KV4  Kotin's competition was rejected and more successful KV-4 designs were reused. R73 KV4  As Dukhov's design was already being worked on and the front-engined tank was too progressive, Tseits' KV-4 was selected. R73 KV4  Nikolai Valentinovich was appointed as the lead designer. R73 KV4  Other engineers from the KV-4 contest were involved in the project: Kuzmin was designing the hull, Sychev the turret and gun mount. R73 KV4  Fedorchuk, the most experienced designer, was given the suspension. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "The KV-4 and KV-5 were in an odd place. R73 KV4  On one hand, GABTU's position was that the KV-3, the work on which was progressing at full throttle, was a temporary solution, and would be replaced in 1942 by the KV-4 or KV-5. R73 KV4  Which design would win would be a matter settled by competitive trials. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the KV-4, approved in May, had nearly no documents completed. R73 KV4  The same could not be said for the KV-5, work on which continued even after the start of the war and the order to cease work. R73 KV4  Even the manufacturing technology was changed. R73 KV4  The last blueprints were dated August of 1941, when the Germans were already near Leningrad. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned above, the KV-5 was based on Tseits' KV-4. R73 KV4  The idea of a tall turret and short hull was expanded upon and adapted to mass production. R73 KV4  The \"step\" in front of the turret was removed. R73 KV4  The driver received a personal casemate, and the hull gunner got a mini turret. R73 KV4  Because of this, the front of the hull was only 920 mm tall. R73 KV4  Second, the circular shape of the main turret was revised. R73 KV4  The front armour grew to 180 mm, making it invincible to any gun of that era. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "==Battle of Phantoms==\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of the KV-4 and KV-5 is usually seen as a senseless waste of time and money. R73 KV4  This is largely true. R73 KV4  Even if the war did not start in 1941, it is doubtful that these tanks could enter mass production. R73 KV4  However, where there's smoke, there's fire. R73 KV4  The mistakes made by Soviet intelligence have a basis in fact. R73 KV4 \n",
      "\n",
      "Study of Bunderarchiv documents shows that, in March of 1941, Kripp began production of the 15 cm K. R73 KV4  L/40 Sfl. R73 KV4 , or 149 mm self-propelled gun. R73 KV4  In the fall of 1941, this project turned into 15 cm L L/40 fur VK 70. R73 KV4 01. R73 KV4  Yes, this is the very same VK 70. R73 KV4 01, better known as Lowe or Pz. R73 KV4 Kpfw. R73 KV4  VII. R73 KV4  The mass of this tank was also 90 tons, and one of the armament variants was a 105 mm gun. R73 KV4  Perhaps this is the Pz. R73 KV4 Kpfw. R73 KV4  VII that intelligence discovered. R73 KV4  In any case, this is not the VK 70. R73 KV4 01 that is widely known now, as sloped armour was only used in Germany after the fall of 1941 when the Germans became familiar with the T-34. R73 KV4 \n",
